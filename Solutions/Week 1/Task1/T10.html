        <h2><u>What is the introduction of math?</u></h2>
        <p>Mathematics is the <mark>Science and study of quality, structure, space, and change.</mark> Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropiately chosen axioms and definitions. <br> There is debate over whether <i>Mathematical</i> objects such as numbers and points exist naturally or are human creations. The mathematician <b>Benjamin peirce</b> called mathematics <q><u>the science that draws necessary conclusions</u></q> <mark>Albert Einstein</mark> on the other hand stated that <q><u>as fas as the laws of mathematics refer to reality they are nto certain and as fat as they are certain the do not refer to reality </u></q> <br> <u>Today, Mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, and the social sciences.</u> Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerened with application of <b>mathematical knowledge</b> to the other fields inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having any applications in mind, although practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.</p>

        <p><mark>Chemistry </mark>is the study of matter and the ways in which different forms of matter combine with eachother <u>You must study chemistry because it helps you understand the world around you.</u> Everything you touch or taste or smell is a <br>
        <b>chemical</b> and the interactions of these chemicals with each other define our universe. <mark><u>Chemistry forms the fundemental basis for biology and medicine.</u></mark> From the structure of proteins and nuclein acids to the design, synthesis and manufacture of drugs, chemistry allows you</p>

        <p> <del>The principle of chemicals are quite varied and are essentially important which includes brain functioning, computer operations, weather patterns, chemical industries, manufacturing fertilizers,acids alkalis, salts, drugs, soaps, etc;</del><br>
         Chemistry also acts as a major determinant in meeting the human needs for food, <i>healthcare</i> products, and also other <mark>materials </mark>are aimed at improving the life's quality.
